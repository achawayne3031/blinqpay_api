Steps to set up (Using Remote Database)
    1. Run "composer install", to install all the dependcies.
    2. Run "php artisan serve" to start up the server
    3. there is a remote database config on the env file, you don't need to run migration




Steps to set up (Using Locally Database)
    1. Run "composer install", to install all the dependcies.
    2. set up your database config locally
    3. Run "php artisan migrate", this will help to migrate the tables to your database
    4. Run "php artisan serve" to start up the server




NOTE:
the remote database will be taken down within a week from the day my assesment was submitted,
in such scenario, please make use of your local database. Thank you
